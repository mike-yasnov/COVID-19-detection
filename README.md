## Data 
The data were obtained using the voltammetry method on eGaIn electrodes. The data is written in a table in the .—Åsv format 


# Determination of the stage of development of the disease (lung damage)
For this, ensemble models were also taken.
The data were supplemented by the content of trace elements in the patient's blood.

There were three classes: mild, moderate, and severe lung injury.
